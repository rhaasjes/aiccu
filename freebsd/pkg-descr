SixXS AICCU: Automatic IPv6 Connectivity Configuration Utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AICCU makes it very easy for anybody to get IPv6 connectivity
everywhere they want. It uses the TIC (Tunnel Information & Control)
protocol to request the information needed to setup a tunnel through
which the connectivity is created.

AICCU supports the following tunneling protocols:
 - 6in4 static    (RFC 2893)
 - 6in4 heartbeat (RFC 2893 + draft-massar-v6ops-heartbeat)
 - tinc           (http://www.tinc-vpn.org)
 - AYIYA          (draft-massar-v6ops-ayiya)

As AYIYA even works from behind NAT's, thus unless there is a very
restrictive firewall in place, anybody should be able to get IPv6
connectivity without problems and everywhere they want.

The main AICCU page, containing information, screenshots, updates
and of course the software itself, unix source + binaries/packages
and Windows binaries, can be downloaded from:
