  * Fixed up silly linux bug, adding LL address to tunnels but not to tun/taps.
  * Removed Win32 Alpha Endianess (reported by Christian Weisgerber).
  * Fixed up alignment error in parseline() (reported by Christian Weisgerber).
  * OpenBSD 4.0 support (patch provided by Christian Weisgerber).

    reported and patch supplied by Matt Domsch.
  * NetBSD AYIYA support (noted by Tobias Riediger)
    Works on NetBSD 4.x, for NetBSD 3.0 one needs to patch tun/tap to
    support IPv6. Patch is available from the archives.
  * local_ipv4_override option so one can use AICCU behind a NAT that
    has been configured correctly to do proto-41 forwarding. This is
    usually called a DMZ setup.

aiccu (20060806) stable; urgency=low
  * Changelog version format change as the 'official' (before there where
    legal issues as they don't understand the word 'SHOULD' which is cleary
    defined in the IETF and now somebody simply uploaded it anyway it without
    even asking or notifying us about it) debian packages which are broken,
    old and unsupported would seem newer and thus this new version would not
    get updated to even when folks would have the official AICCU repository
    in their sources.list. This solves that issue.
  * pidfile fixup and configuration parameter.
  * Corrected Broker selection in debconf.
  * Configuration file rewriting by debconf is now done in a 'nice' way.
