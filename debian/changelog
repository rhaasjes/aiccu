aiccu (20070115) stable; urgency=medium
  * Fixup in Debian init script (based on original patch by Bernhard Schmidt).
  * Change in redirections so that errors don't show in debconf menu's etc.
  * NetBSD fixes as there is not always a Tunnel Device that
    supports IPv6 (thanks to Geert Hendrickx).
  * Gentoo ebuild update, adding depends and require ntp-client.
  * RPM spec update, add build-requirement.
  * Check return values of system commands.
  * Added a big warning about running AICCU from Daemontools and similar
    programs which run AICCU in a loop, thus hammering the TIC server.
  * Be a bit smarter in checking for support of IPv6.

aiccu (20070107) stable; urgency=high
  * 2007 Edition of AICCU.
  * License change to standard 3-clause BSD license.
    With thanks to Theo de Raadt, Marco d'Itri and Philipp Kern for
    their wise words and reasoning for coming to this decision.
  * High urgency because of the above and it fixing large problems.
  * Fixed Mac OS X / Darwin support on the MacBookPro of Pim van Pelt.
  * Added MTU, from TIC, configuration on most platforms.
  * Fixed up silly linux bug, adding LL address to tunnels but not to tun/taps.
  * Removed Win32 Alpha Endianess (reported by Christian Weisgerber).
  * Fixed up alignment error in parseline() (reported by Christian Weisgerber).
  * OpenBSD 4.0 support (patch provided by Christian Weisgerber).
  * OpenBSD AYIYA fixup (patch provided by Pim van Pelt).
  * Fedora/RPM init script fixup (bash case's don't fall through)
    reported and patch supplied by Matt Domsch.
  * NetBSD AYIYA support (noted by Tobias Riediger)
    Works on NetBSD 4.x, for NetBSD 3.0 one needs to patch tun/tap to
    support IPv6. Patch is available from the archives.
  * local_ipv4_override option so one can use AICCU behind a NAT that
    has been configured correctly to do proto-41 forwarding. This is
    usually called a DMZ setup.

aiccu (20060806) stable; urgency=low
  * Changelog version format change as the 'official' (before there where
    legal issues as they don't understand the word 'SHOULD' which is cleary
    defined in the IETF and now somebody simply uploaded it anyway it without
    even asking or notifying us about it) debian packages which are broken,
    old and unsupported would seem newer and thus this new version would not
    get updated to even when folks would have the official AICCU repository
    in their sources.list. This solves that issue.
  * pidfile fixup and configuration parameter.
  * Corrected Broker selection in debconf.
  * Configuration file rewriting by debconf is now done in a 'nice' way.
