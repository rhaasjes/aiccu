SixXS AICCU: Automatic IPv6 Connectivity Configuration Utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AICCU makes it very easy for anybody to get IPv6 connectivity
everywhere they want. It uses the TIC (Tunnel Information & Control)
protocol to request the information needed to setup a tunnel through
which the connectivity is created.

AICCU supports the following tunneling protocols:
 - 6in4 static    (RFC 2893)
 - 6in4 heartbeat (RFC 2893 + draft-massar-v6ops-heartbeat)
 - AYIYA          (draft-massar-v6ops-ayiya)
 
As AYIYA even works from behind NAT's, thus unless there is a very
restrictive firewall in place, anybody should be able to get IPv6
connectivity without problems and everywhere they want.

WARNING: never run AICCU from DaemonTools or a similar automated
'restart' tool/script. When AICCU does not start, it has a reason
not to start which it gives on either the stdout or in the (sys)log
file. The TIC server *will* automatically disable accounts which
are detected to run in this mode.

The main AICCU page, containing information, screenshots, updates
and of course the software itself, unix source + binaries/packages
and Windows binaries, can be downloaded from:
