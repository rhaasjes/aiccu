.SH NAME
AICCU \- Automatic IPv6 Connectivity Configuration Utility
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBaiccu \fR \fB<start|stop|tunnels|test|autotest|license>\fR [ \fB\fIconfig\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
AICCU makes it very easy for anybody to get IPv6 connectivity
everywhere they want. It uses the TIC (Tunnel Information & Control)
protocol to request the information needed to setup a tunnel through
which the connectivity is created.
AICCU supports the following tunneling protocols:
- 6in4 static    (RFC 2893)
- 6in4 heartbeat (RFC 2893 + draft-massar-v6ops-heartbeat)
- tinc           (http://www.tinc-vpn.org)
- AYIYA          (draft-massar-v6ops-ayiya)
As AYIYA even works from behind NAT's, thus unless there is a very
restrictive firewall in place, anybody should be able to get IPv6
connectivity without problems and everywhere they want.
